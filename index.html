      <p id="quotes"><em>"Al-Hussein deservedly deserved the title of Al-Malik Al-Bani, he was one of the few leaders who mastered
        the art of governance. This is mainly due to his affiliation with the Holy Prophet Muhammad, his involvement
        in the Hashemite family."<br><br> The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Kamel Abu Jaber</em></p>
